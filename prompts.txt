1. generate a markdown file based on my provide subject, extract a title and a corresponding file name with most 4 words. for example, the filename is 'rounding-corners.md' and the extracted_title is "Rounding Corners".

2. find the right place to put under the docs folder with semantic meanings.
for example,  the subject is about tailwindcss v4, then put the markdown file into folder 'docs/tailwind-v4' as {filename}.

3. If the semantic folder does not exist, you should create a new one under 'docs' folder. For example, if you think the semantic folder would be 'mcp', then create a folder like 'docs/mcp'. And then initial a _category_.json file by default. The file should contain a json dict like :
```json
{
  "label": "Tailwindcss v4 practice",
  "position": 3,
  "link": {
    "type": "generated-index"
  }
}
```
which label means the category of the folder, position means the order it will be displayed on the sidebar. The position should never coflict with the same level directory.

4. If the category folder is new, add a configuration under sidebars.ts like:
'''
    {
      type: 'category',
      label: 'Tailwindcss v4',
      collapsed: false,
      items: [
        {
          type: 'autogenerated',
          dirName: 'tailwind-v4',
        },
      ],
    },
'''
Update the label and dirName for the new one.

5. Add additional part at top of the generated markdown to meet the docusaurus docs publish requirements like:

'''
---
sidebar_position: {sequence_of_the_file}
title: {extracted_title}
---
'''

6. Test building the docs with command `npm run build` to check if the new added file format is correct. Fix any error if the file contents is incorrect.
